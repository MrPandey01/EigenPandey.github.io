I am a Ph.D. researcher at [Stadius Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) with [Prof. Johan Suykens](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/members/suykens.html) working on the generously funded ERC Advanced Grant [E-DUALITY](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/E/) project. My current research efforts include finding synergies between the Kernel Methods and Deep Learning; classically two distinct fields in machine learning, with applications towards dynamical systems modeling, time series prediction and computer vision.

Prior to my Ph.D., I did masters in Applied Mathematics as an Erasmus Mundus scholar and consequently earned a Joint MSc degree from [Universität Hamburg, Germany](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en.html); [Università degli Studi dell’Aquila, Italy](www.disim.univaq.it); [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain](https://www.uab.cat/en/). Further, I earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering from [VIT University, Vellore, India](https://vit.ac.in/). Professionally, I worked for 1-year as an Associate Engineer in Product Development at Ford Motors, Chennai, India.

Outside academia, I enjoy outdoors, hiking and traveling to new places!
