I am a Ph.D. researcher at [Stadius Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) with [Prof. Johan Suykens](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/members/suykens.html) working on the generously funded ERC Advanced Grant [E-DUALITY](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/E/) project. 

I work on the methods and algorithms side of machine learning. My current research efforts include finding synergies between the Kernel Methods and Deep Learning. Mathematical models built as a consequence are applied towards dynamical systems modeling, time series prediction and computer vision.

Before my Ph.D., I did a joint MSc in Applied Mathematics as an Erasmus Mundus scholar ([MathMods](https://www.mathmods.eu/)) from [Universität Hamburg, Germany](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en.html); [Università Degli Studi dell’Aquila, Italy](www.disim.univaq.it); [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain](https://www.uab.cat/en/). Further, I earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering from [VIT University, Vellore, India](https://vit.ac.in/). Professionally, I worked for 1-year as Associate Engineer in the Product Development, Ford Motors, Chennai, India.

Outside research, I enjoy the outdoors, especially hiking and traveling to new places! I'm also a huge FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) enthusiast. As a hobby, I currently maintain my home server for several web applications.
