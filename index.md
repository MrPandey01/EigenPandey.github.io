I am a Ph.D. researcher at [Stadius Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) with [Prof. Johan Suykens](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/members/suykens.html) working on the generously funded ERC Advanced Grant [E-DUALITY](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/E/) project. 

Typically I work on the methods and algorithms side of machine learning. My current research efforts include finding synergies between the Kernel Methods and Deep Learning which are classically two distinct fields in machine learning. Mathematical models thus built are applied towards dynamical systems modeling, time series prediction and computer vision.

Prior to my Ph.D., I did a master's in Applied Mathematics as an Erasmus Mundus scholar and consequently earned a Joint MSc degree from [Universität Hamburg, Germany](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en.html); [Università degli Studi dell’Aquila, Italy](www.disim.univaq.it); [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain](https://www.uab.cat/en/). Further, I earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical engineering from [VIT University, Vellore, India](https://vit.ac.in/). Professionally, I worked for 1-year as an Associate Engineer in the Product Development department, Ford Motors, Chennai, India.

Outside academia, I enjoy the outdoors, especially hiking and traveling to new places!
